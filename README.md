The Game Player lets you experience your interactive story.

### Steps:
- Load a scenario (.json file).

- Make choices to navigate through the story.
- Character attributes change based on choices.

## üåê Scenario Visualizer (visio.py)
The Scenario Visualizer helps you see the structure of your story as a graph.

### Steps:
- Load a scenario (.json file).
- View the graph representation of the story.
- Nodes represent scenes, and arrows show transitions between them.
- Drag nodes to adjust the view.

## File Format (JSON)
Scenarios are saved as `.json` files with the following structure:

```json
{
    "character": {
        "health": 100,
        "strength": 10,
        "money": 50
    },
    "scenes": {
        "scene1": {
            "text": "You wake up in a dark forest...",
            "choices": [
                {
                    "text": "Go left",
                    "next_scene": "scene2",
                    "effect": {"health": -10}
                },
                {
                    "text": "Go right",
                    "next_scene": "scene3"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
